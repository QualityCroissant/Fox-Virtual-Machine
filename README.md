<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To set up ready to use FVM, download the latest release under the releases section, unzip it, and enjoy!
If you want to learn how to use it, the wiki contains a basic guide, which also describes how it works.
Any additions, forks, and edits are very much welcomed. However, please be patient, as the project is still in its alpha stage!
