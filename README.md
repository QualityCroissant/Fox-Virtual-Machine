<h1>Fox Virtual Machine</h1>
<h2>A virtual machine aiming to be simplistic, fast, and easily reïmplementable</h2>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

**Important:** FVM now supports graphics! However, this means you must have GLFW installed on your system to be able to use it.

To set up ready to use FVM, download the latest release under the releases section, unzip it, and enjoy!
If you want to learn how to use it, the wiki contains a basic guide, which also describes how it works.
Any additions, forks, and edits are very much welcomed. However, please be patient, as the project is still in its alpha stage!

<h3>Just want to give it a try?</h3>

FVM now has its own demo suite hosted on Github Pages! Check it out here: https://qualitycroissant.github.io/fvmonline/ (currently on FVM v0.3-alpha)
